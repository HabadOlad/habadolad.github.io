    <h1>Habad's/conway Game of Life</h1>
    <p>Conwayâ€™s Game of Life starts with a 2d grid, and each cell in the grid being either alive or dead. The grid will then evolve after each iteration based on the following rules:</p>
        <p>Rules of the Game:</p>
        <p>Any living cell with less than 2 live neighbors dies</p>
        <p>Any living cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors continues to be alive</p> 
        <p>Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell</p>
        <p>Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies</p>
        <p>Following these rules, each cell counts the number of live cells adjacent to it and determines its upcoming status.</p>
