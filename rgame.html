<h1>The Ruminant Game</h1>
<h2>The American Psychological Association (APA) defines rumination as “obsessional thinking involving excessive, repetitive thoughts or themes that interfere with other forms of mental activity.”</h2>
<h2>The word rumination actually comes from ruminants - aka cows, animals which chew their cud. 'Chewing the cud' is when a portion of food returns from a ruminant's stomach to the mouth, to be rechewed. Much like we do with our thoughts</h2>
<h2>Essentially this game is an amalgamation of my quote generator and learning how to use svg/pngs to make a talking animal game</h2>
<h2>The aim of the game ....</h2>
<!--The aim of the game is to have the farmer fill up the feed and for the ruminant animal to try consume as much cud/feed as-->
