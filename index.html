    <div class="panel">
      <p>Currently living my dream job as a software engineer! Prior i was a qualified tutor and postgraduate researcher with a background in consulting. Worked on the UKâ€™s most high-profile infrastructure developments such as High Speed 2 and Heathrow terminal expansion. Skilled in creating positive relationships with customers and stakeholders. Experienced in data analytics, tutoring, project management, database administration and consulting.

      <p>My earliest programming experience was with Neopets back in the 90's/early 2000s. I initially would make mini websites for my neopets and change the colour of the font with html. For some odd reason i never pursued this further and veered away from the programming and had a passion for the environment. I always felt intimidated by programmers, thinking they were mathematical savants but it was just insecruity on my part. I studied geography as an undergrad and a masters in environmental technology. My first job was in consulting, although rewarding 
        i knew it was not my forte. I moved onto data analytics which meant i had to learn python to manipulate CSV files and create graphs using matplotlib/numpy/seaborn (and a little bit of VB basic!). This reinvigorated my passion for code. Thankfully i found a wonderful bootcamp called Founders and Coders which aided me in my journey. This website not only showcases my skill with html,css and javascript it's also an aide with a plethora of links, motivational quotes and fun little games!</p>
        <p>Habad Olad holds a Msc in Environmental Technology from Imperial College London and a Bsc in Geography and Geology from the University of Hull.</p>
