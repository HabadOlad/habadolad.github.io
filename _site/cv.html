    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p class="about-me-text">
      My earliest code experience was building mini-sites for my Neopets in the
      late '90s, an initial spark that lay dormant while I pursued a deep
      passion for the environment and sciences. I earned an MSc in Environmental
      Technology from Imperial College London and spent my early career
      contributing to the UK's largest infrastructure developments, such as High
      Speed 2 (HS2) and the Heathrow Terminal Expansion. This work honed my
      skills in project management, stakeholder relationship building, and
      operating in complex, high-pressure environments. My passion for code was
      reignited in data analytics, where I became proficient in using Python
      (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and VB Basic to transform raw CSV data into
      actionable insights.
