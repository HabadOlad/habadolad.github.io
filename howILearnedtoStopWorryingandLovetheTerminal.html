    <h1>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Terminal</h1>
    <p>The title of this blog post is a parody of Stanley Kubrick's magnus opus, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.
I am and was absolutely terrified of the terminal, i was absolutely terrified of using git hub on the command line interface , i totally noobed out out used the source control VS code button, and i still didn't understand github actiobs/cli/the terminal.
I got my buddy (shout out C.Scott!) to baby me and hold my hide whilst i went through the my first actions , git add ., git commit -m "" , git status etc. etc. all of them foreign to me, i felt like a hacker in that film swordfish, really strange film in hindsight.
