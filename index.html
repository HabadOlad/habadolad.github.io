    <div class="panel">
      <p>Currently living my dream job as a software engineer! Prior i was a qualified tutor and postgraduate researcher with a background in consulting. Worked on the UKâ€™s most high-profile infrastructure developments such as High Speed 2 and Heathrow terminal expansion. Skilled in creating positive relationships with customers and stakeholders. Experienced in data analytics, tutoring, project management, database administration and consulting.
      </p>
      <p>My programming journey began with a childhood fascination for creating mini websites on Neopets in the late 90s, aswell as the gameboy colour. Although I initially veered away from technology to pursue a passion for the environment, earning a BSc in Geography and Geology from the University of Hull and an MSc in Environmental Technology from Imperial College London, I've now circled back to my roots in code.

        My return to programming was sparked during my time in data analytics, where I was required to learn Python to manipulate data and create visualizations. This experience, using libraries like Matplotlib, NumPy, and Seaborn, reignited my passion for coding. Now, I create and share my own projects, not only to showcase my skills but also to serve as a resource for others. This website is a testament to thatâ€”a collection of my work, complemented by useful links, motivational quotes, and even fun, interactive games.</p>
