    <p class="about-me-text">
      The journey to my dream job as a Software Engineer was not a straight
      line, but every step added a crucial layer to my current expertise. My
      earliest code experience was building mini-sites for my Neopets in the
      late '90s, an initial spark that lay dormant while I pursued a deep
      passion for the environment. I earned an MSc in Environmental Technology
      from Imperial College London and spent my early career contributing to the
      UK's largest infrastructure developments, such as High Speed 2 (HS2) and
      the Heathrow Terminal Expansion. This work honed my skills in project
      management, stakeholder relationship building, and operating in complex,
      high-pressure environments. My passion for code was reignited in data
      analytics, where I became proficient in using Python (NumPy, Matplotlib,
      Seaborn) and VB Basic to transform raw CSV data into actionable insights.
      Driven by this renewed interest, I taught myself modern web development
      and successfully transitioned into a Software Engineering role. This
      website is a testament to that self-taught journey, showcasing my HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript skills while also serving as a helpful resource filled
      with links, games, and motivational insights.
