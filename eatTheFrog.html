    <title>Eat the Frog -  a game to fight procrastination</title>
    <h2>The phrase originates from a quote often attributed to Mark Twain, which goes, “If it’s your job to eat a frog, it’s best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it’s your job to eat two frogs, it’s best to eat the biggest one first.”</h2>
    <h2>So obivously the game will be about eating frogs, hopefully you only ever play this game for 5 to 10 minutes and then stop the procrastination!</h2>
    <h2>Chomp....chomp.....chomp....or....is it.....nom nom nom?</h2>
