<h1>Are you a: Perfectionist? Dreamer? Defier? Worrier? Crisis-maker? Overdoer or Underdoer?</h1>
<h2>Funnily enough i made this page whilst procrastinating, i didnt want to code and was just in a low mood, just just copied and pasted quotes and compiled them, listened to a bit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-48krZZ2Pw" target="_blank" >Tatsuro Yamashita</a>, if you look at the JS script you'll laugh.</h2>
<h2>I hope this helps the users. I have suffered tremendously from low mood and depression.
    This lead to a signifcant period of unemployment and severe anxiety disorder in my life.
    This is most definitely not an aide or remedy against such disorders, 
    rather a little helpful boost whilst you're battling away at life! And if you find yourself
coming back to this app/page. Well good for you! you're trying!</h2>
<h3>However, if you've gone through all the quotes (quotes>100) and are still on his page!
     STOP YOU'RE SELF! BEGIN WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO AND FAIL AT IT!
    Write that song! Shave your face! Hit the gym! Use that dating app! Write Hello world ! Start a Youtube channel! </h3>

        <p>91.	I didn’t want my picture taken because I was going to cry. I didn’t know why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or looked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the sobs would fly out of my throat and I’d cry for a week. I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full. -  Sylvia Plath</p>
